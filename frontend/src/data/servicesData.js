              Exterior Trench Treatment – After the exterior walls are up, a trench is made around the entire building deep enough to expose the footing. This trench is thoroughly treated. As it is refilled with soil, the replaced soil is saturated with the solution. Pre-construction treatment can be timed to fit into your building schedule. With our careful coordination with that of your building work, termite control can be achieved without the slightest delay in construction. Such treatment generally guarantees immunity from termites for at least 7/10 years.
